 A story of a boy who became as free as wind...
    	He was an ordinary young boy without a past. He was told of course, and many times that time itself exists. But he never believed. Big scintists 
    and old wise men had been repeting all the time and all the same. Reels and Stories went by. Life was full of events: bright colorful days 
    changed more colorful nights, stars felt on hands of new generation true dreamers. Sun raised every single day exept this one. It seems 
    like it was too late to raise, everybody didn't want to notice this circumstance. 
    They had no time they had no a single second to stay and think about the Sun. Except him. He had time, enought.
